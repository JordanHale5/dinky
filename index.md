## My Website

Hello there. My name is Jordan, and I am currently studding computer science. I recently became interested in computer science only a couple of months ago. It was actually my friend who introduced me to it and I have been intrigued ever since. This is the beginning of my website that will soon display all of my projects. I hope to have a couple done by the end of the year, so check back later.

## Personal Life
I have a good amount of hobbies. I have recently started to become pretty good at skateboarding. I love snowboarding, and only started 3 years ago. Now I'm always excited for winter. I go to the gym pretty consistantly since I think living a healthy lifestyle is imprtant and I have recently started eating healthier. And of course I play video games pretty often. Surprisly though I only play with friends because I get bored to fast playing alone.
